# MyMAST
MyMAST is the web application responsible for running all programs related to the Memorial Academy of Science and Technology. The app is intended to connect students, parents, volunteers, program directors, and organization leaders in a central ecosystem.

## Parents

Parents create an account that allows them to sign up for programs with a minimal number of clicks. Important information is stored on the parent's account and automatically linked to their enrollments. Additionally, parents will be able to fill out any necessary forms (ex: waivers) directly from the web interface.

Once enrolled, parents will be able to receive confirmation and updates on their enrollment directly from MyMAST.

## Students
Student accounts are linked directly to the parent's account (and must be created by a parent account), however utilizing separate login credentials, reducing the complexities of logging in and ensuring easy tracking of student enrollments, and creating a foundation for students to receive activities directly from MAST team members via MyMAST (with parents able to observe from their dashboard).

## Volunteers
